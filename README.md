# Time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation 
time-independent SE is solved using Numerov method in which we caculate eigenvalues and eigenstates for a specific spherical potentials for each angulare momentum $\ell$
\par
Our energy box supports the bound states and continumm state up to $E_{\rm max}$. The continum state is caculated in a box which is called ``box" solutions. The boundary consition for a box solution is that a state should reach zero at the end of the box.
