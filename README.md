# Time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation 
time-independent SE is solved using Numerov method in which we caculate eigenvalues and eigenstates for a specific spherical potentials for each angulare momentum $\ell$.



Our energy box supports the bound states and continumm state up to $E_{\rm max}$. The continum state is caculated in a box which is called ``box" solutions. The boundary consition for a box solution is that a state should reach zero at the end of the box.



Then we caculate the dipole matrix element $d_{n\ell ,  n' \ell^{\prime}} = \langle \psi_{n' \ell^{\prime}} |r| \psi_{n\ell } \rangle $
