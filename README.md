# Time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation 
time-independent SE is solved using Numerov method in which we caculate eigenvalues and eigenstates for a specific spherical potential for each angulare momentum $\ell$.



Our energy box supports bound states and continumm state up to $E_{\rm max}$. The continum state is caculated in a box which is called ``box" solutions. The boundary condition for a box solution is that a state should reach zero at the end of the box.



Then we caculate the dipole matrix element $d_{n\ell ,  n' \ell^{\prime}} = \langle \psi_{n' \ell^{\prime}} |r| \psi_{n\ell } \rangle $


Having Hamiltoniam in velocity gauge 
$H_{n\ell ,  n' \ell^{\prime}} = E_{n\ell} \delta_{n\ell ,  n' \ell^{\prime}} + \mathrm{i} A(t) (E_{n\ell} - E_{ n' \ell^{\prime}}) d_{n\ell ,  n' \ell^{\prime}}$ where $A(t)$ is the vector potential, we can porpagate it in time.
$$a(t) = exp() a(t)$$
